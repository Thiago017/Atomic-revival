# Atomic revival

> **Note:** This theme is a combination/adaptation of the projects [Atomize](https://github.com/emroussel/atomize) (by Emmanuel Roussel) and [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) (by Binaryify). Both original projects are under the MIT license and their authors are duly credited below.

**The most faithful Visual Studio Code theme to the classic Atom One Dark.**  
It combines the interface from [Atomize](https://github.com/emroussel/atomize) with the syntax highlighting from [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro), offering a nostalgic and modern experience at the same time.

## ‚ú® Why "Atomic revival"?

- Atom-inspired UI via **Atomize**
- Authentic color scheme from **One Dark Pro**
- Additional visual tweaks for greater fidelity
